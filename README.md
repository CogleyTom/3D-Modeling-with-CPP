How do I approach designing software?
**When designing my project for this class I chose multiple models and took a picture of them.  I constantly looked back on the image to ensure my 3D program was looking similar to my 2D image.  Also, when thinking about the lighting and my texture I had to plan what would work well together.  These tactics can be applied in my future work by planning any program I want to develop.  Planning is a crucial role in software developing.**

How do I approach developing programs?
**As for my developing strategies with this project, I ensured all of my code worked properly.  I was constantly testing and changin little variables.  I also put many comments throughout my code.  Throughout the milestones for my project, I constantly improved upon my previous weeks milestone.  I also saved many copies of my project because I kept changing it drastically to get the end product I wanted.  This program had more lines of code, header files, and CPP files then anything I have worked on in the past.  This project helped me understand how to organize it all logically, and how everything works together.**

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
**This class was not only my hardest class in my degree path it was also my most informative.  I had much practice with pointers which I struggle with.  Also, as mentioned, I used many header files and other CPP files and connected them all properly.  I also got much practice with debugging.  This class will help me with my future educational and professional pathway more than any other class has.**
